# Details
## **Discrimination**
Discrimination is not allowed on the site. This includes discriminating by race, gender, health conditions, sexuality, and many others. Using racial slurs is included in this rule and it’s not  allowed either. Nobody on Multiplayer Piano should feel unwelcome because of their race, gender, etc.
## **Inappropriate content**
A large amount of the site’s users are under 18 years old, so sexual content is not allowed here at all. Sharing links in public chat to sites which have sexual content, including meetings, is not allowed and will result in a ban. Sharing links to regular, appropriate, meetings is allowed. Additionally, images which may be disturbing should not be shared publicly. Rooms that advertise looking for a date, boyfriend, girlfriend, or similar are not allowed. Often the creator or people who join them are young, leading to possible grooming.
## **Discussing self-harm or other very negative topics**
If you need immediate help, there are [**hotlines**](https://www.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines) where you can get it. Often when people ask for this kind of support on Multiplayer Piano it does more harm than help. In many cases, someone may use the threat of suicide to get attention or to get others to do things. Talking about self-harm in direct messages or private rooms with close friends is allowed. The purpose of this rule is not to stop people from getting help, but to keep the subject off of Multiplayer Piano because it doesn’t belong here.
## **Spamming the piano or chat in lobbies**
Lobbies are any room which is yellow and does not have a crown. They are typically the first thing a user will see when they enter the site, so there are some restrictions on what users can do there. Spamming the piano and chat is not permitted in lobbies. Pressing a bunch of keys on your keyboard is not enough spam to be against the rules, but autoclicking and midis made for spam do break the rules in lobbies, private rooms or rooms with a crown are up to the room owner. Chat spam is defined as sending multiple similar messages that serve no purpose, sending zalgo text which interferes with other chat messages, or sending very long messages with repeated or long characters (such as ﷽). In non lobby rooms(any room with a crown) spam is allowed. MPP does not have a turn system. If you’re in a non lobby room, don't expect someone to stop just because you told them to, if you own your own room you’re free to enforce your own turn system.
## **Evasion of bans or mutes**
The reason for this rule should be self-explanatory, if you’re banned then you need to wait out your ban. Evading a ban will result in the evading ID being banned and may result in an increased ban time for your main ID. Evading kickbans and chat mutes from other users is also not allowed.
## **Exploiting bugs**
If you find a bug in the server, please report it by opening a ticket on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RjEttXpNbE). Attempting to find bugs and testing bugs is allowed as long as it doesn’t damage anything. Abusing a bug will result in a ban.
## **Phishing and IP grabbers**
Sending any sort of IP grabber link is bannable. Sending links to phishing sites (sites that trick people into giving passwords or other personal information) is also not allowed.
## **Abusing bots or scripts**
The main page on this subject can be found [here](https://github.com/Hyye123/OpenMPP/blob/master/bot_guide.md). Generally, you should only use bots and scripts with good intention.
## **Promoting violence, illegal, or dangerous activities on the site**
Don’t do this. It should be self explanatory why this is bannable.
## **Promoting breaking the rules**
This is self explanatory. Encouraging rule-breaking in a joking way may not be bannable at the discretion of staff. This rule is mostly in place to stop people from getting others banned by telling them to do something that’s not allowed.
## **Giving out another other user’s personal information without their consent**
Personal information is meant to be kept personal. Don’t tell others someone’s personal information unless they have given you permission. Personal information includes but is not limited to the following:

- Locations more specific than a city
- Real names
- IP addresses
- Personal email addresses
## **Disrupting users throughout multiple rooms**
Advertising meetings, websites, social media, or anything else throughout rooms is not allowed. It gets annoying for everyone else and is generally considered rude. Advertising in a single room you own is allowed. Spamming the piano and getting banned in multiple rooms, with the intention of disrupting other users, is also not allowed.
## **Holding the crown in a room that does not belong to you**
A lot of users go to the same room day after day and expect the same people to be there managing it. If you pick up the crown in a room you don’t own and the old owner shows up, please be respectful and give it back to them. Whether this results in a ban is at the discretion of staff. Often it is hard to determine who owned a room or whether that owner was being responsible with the crown.
## **Abusing permissions or higher quotas**
If you ask on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RjEttXpNbE) for a higher note quota to play black midis, we aren’t stingy about it and will likely give it to you. However, you’re expected to use it responsibly. Don’t annoy people with it and only play black midis in rooms where the owner is ok with it. The same idea goes for any other permission or quota you may be given.
## **Misleading other users in a negative way**
This rule mainly applies for things such as impersonation. Small pranks and jokes are usually fine, but don’t hurt someone else’s reputation or take it too far. Lying or spreading rumors about other users is counted as misleading and is not allowed. Exactly what does and doesn’t result in a ban is at the discretion of staff.
